# Web page titled: dashboardv2025
## Deployed at https://scotcorm.github.io/dashboardv2025/
## Built with ChartJS and Bootstrap, original site foundation based on a Bootstrap Example from: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/

## About
Most of what I have learned so far about building charts and graphs has been using React, with data being added and 
updated in an external server.  Since full-stack projects like the one that I have currently hosted on Render take time to spin 
up, it wasn't as practical for me to experiment more with ChartJS, and so I used Bootstrap for this one.
